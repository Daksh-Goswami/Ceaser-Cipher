The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”.
So this program helps you to encrypt your messages based upon the encryption method deduced by julius ceaser.
